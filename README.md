## 📘 Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of three real-world machine learning tasks completed as part of my internship at Cognifyz Technologies. The tasks focus on applying regression models, recommendation systems, and location-based analytics to a restaurant dataset.

---

## 📌 Selected Tasks

### 🔹 Task 1: Predict Restaurant Ratings (Regression)
- Built a regression model to predict restaurant ratings using features like cuisines, price range, location, and user votes.
- Used Linear Regression and Decision Tree models.
- Evaluated model performance using MSE and R² score.

### 🔹 Task 2: Restaurant Recommendation System (Content-Based Filtering)
- Developed a recommendation engine using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.
- Allowed real-time recommendations based on restaurant name input.
- Deployed using an interactive **Gradio** interface.

### 🔹 Task 4: Location-Based Restaurant Analysis (Geospatial Insights)
- Conducted spatial analysis of restaurants using latitude, longitude, and city.
- Visualized restaurant density, ratings, and cuisine diversity using Folium, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
